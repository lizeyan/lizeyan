I am currently employed at ByteDance, specializing in the field of AI for Infrastructure and AIOps. 

In 2023, I graduated with a Ph.D. in Computer Science at Tsinghua University, with a research focus on AIOps, failure management, and root cause analysis. 
Throughout my academic journey, I have published several papers on anomaly detection and failure diagnosis at renowned conferences, including ESEC/FSE, WWW, KDD and ISSRE. 

Prior to pursuing my doctoral studies, I earned a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Tsinghua University in 2014.
